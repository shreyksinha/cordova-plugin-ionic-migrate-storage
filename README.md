# `cordova-plugin-ionic-migrate-storage`

> Cordova plugin that migrates localStorage data from cordova-plugin-ionic-webview@1.X.X to cordova-plugin-ionic-webview@4.X.X and above. This works for iOS only!

## Installation

Straight forward, just via `cordova plugin add`.

```
cordova plugin add --save @kassamina/cordova-plugin-ionic-migrate-storage@0.3.3
```

This work is forked from https://github.com/pointmanhq/cordova-plugin-ionic-migrate-storage, which migrates IndexedDB, LocalStorage, and WebSQL from cordova's default UIWebView to cordova-plugin-ionic-webview. We needed to migrate not from the default UIWebView, but from cordova-plugin-ionic-webview@1.X.X to cordova-plugin-ionic-webview@4.X.X, and only localStorage was needed, so IndexedDB and WebSQL support were removed and the migration locations were made configurable. Theoretically, this plugin could also be used to migrate from UIWebView to cordova-plugin-ionic-migrate-storage. The following settings are configurable (defaults listed):

## Testing

To test this, you will have to do the following:

* Delete the app from your device
* Remove the webview and migrate plugins from your app:

```
cordova plugin rm --save cordova-plugin-ionic-webview @kassamina/cordova-plugin-ionic-migrate-storage
```

* Build your app and run it. Store something in localStorage, WebSQL and IndexedDB.
* Add the plugins back:
        
```
cordova plugin add --save cordova-plugin-ionic-webview@4.1.3 @kassamina/cordova-plugin-ionic-migrate-storage@0.3.3
```

* Build your app and run it. The stored data must all exist!

## Caveats / Warnings / Gotchas

* Until the plugin reaches `v.1.0.0`, breaking changes will be introduced in every minor version upgrade! Use one of [the tags listed here](https://github.com/kassamina/cordova-plugin-ionic-migrate-storage/releases) if you want to lock it down to a specific changeset.
* **This has only been tested with  `ios`, migrating from `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview@1.2.1` to `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview@4.1.3`!**
* Currently, this plugin does not work on simulators. PRs welcome!
* This copy is uni-directional, from old webview to new webview. It does not go the other way around. So essentially, this plugin will run only once!

* Add some unit testing.
* Open source stuff - github issue templates, CONTRIBUTING doc, Local development doc etc.
